# RemoteSLAM

The purpose of this repo is to provide the building blocks (software, hardware and algorithms) for implementing SLAM systems using small and lite weight sensors (e.g., cameras, imu).
We plan to improve this repo as we go, while receiving assistance from the community.
Currently, the tool supports 4 types of monochrome cameras/sensors, combined with the Invense MPU 9X50 family:
* Matrix-Vision:  mvBlueFOX3-M/MLC

* IDS-Imaging:  UI3271LE-M-GL

* Arducam:

* Waveshare:

For the lense, a fisheye or wide FOV lense is highly recommended. See this page on our Wiki for some tips: https://github.com/tau-adl/RemoteSLAM/wiki/Camera-IMU-Calibration.
Currently, the heavy lifting (SLAM algorithms) takes place on a remote host computer, receiving sensor data over wifi. This makes it easier to both test and develop different SLAM algorithms and new features.

The SLAM algorithms currently supported are:
* OrbSLAM3 (mono and mono+imu).

    See more support on our Wiki page
* VINS-Fusion (mono+imu). Wiki page

    https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono
    See more support on our Wiki page
* DSO and LDSO (mono). Wiki page

ROS wrappers (for real time implementations) are provided for both the sensors and the SLAM algorithms (where not available in the original repo).

## Hardware and software overview

![PI_Case](https://github.com/tau-adl/RemoteSLAM/blob/main/PI_case_small.jpg)

A Raspberry Pi 4, running Ubuntu 18, was chosen as the the edge computer for reading and transmitting the sensors' data over wifi. General installation instructions for the PI are provided here pi wiki page. A PI image will be uploaded in the near future.

An ubuntu 18 host computer receives the data from the PI, and runs the different SLAM algorithms. We (make our best effort to) provide all the links, relevant information and Ros wrappers needed for implementing and running the different SLAM algorithms in real time.Â
