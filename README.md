# RemoteSLAM

### The purpose of this repo is to provide the building blocks (software, hardware and algorithms) for implementing SLAM using small and lite weight sensors (e.g., cameras, imu).
We plan to improve it as we go, while receiving assistance from the community.
Currently the tool supports 3 types of monochrome cameras and the Invense MPU

For the lense, a fisheye or wide FOV lense, is highly reccomended.
Currently, the heavy lifting (SLAM algorithms) takes place on a remote host computer, receiving sensor data over wifi. This makes it easier both to test and develop different SLAM algorithms and new features.

The SLAM algorithms currently supported are:
OrbSLAM3 (mono and mono+imu)
VINS-Fusion (mono+imu)
DSO and LDSO (mono)

ROS wrappers (for real time implementations) are provided for both the sensors and the SLAM algorithms.

Installations:
Pi You can download an Ubuntu18 based image for the pi4 here.

Host ORBSLAM3 can be installed from


Operating instructions:
On the pi, the ROS workspace for the Bluefox camera is named mvBluefox_ws. Remember to source it in the .bashrc . the ROS workspace for the IDS camera is named
